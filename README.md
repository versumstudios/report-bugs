# report-bugs
In an effort to try to document bug more effectively than leaving them on our Discord we have created this github.

It requires users to have an account with Github.

## How to report an issue?
Please have a read through the existing  Issues tab. Someone might already have reported the same thing you did. If that's the case, leave a comment on that issue, do not create a new one.

Issues with limited description will not help us reproduce or investigate it properly. Please leave screenshots of your browser dev tools so any javascript error can be picked up and the cause identified. Please leave a description of what exactly you were trying to do so we can reproduce the same steps and hit that same error.
